<h1>Behavior Language for Embedded Systems with Software (BLESS)</h1>

<p>
The Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) expresses systems-engineering models of embedded computer systems.  
AADL models computer systems that control machines, particularly safety-critical machines such as aircraft, medical devices, and automobiles.
More can be found about AADL at 
<a href="http://aadl.info">AADL.info</a>.
</p>

<p>
AADL supports extension of the core architecture language with definition of properties
and annex sublanguages.  AADL properties define values for architectural entities.
AADL annex subclauses attach text in a domain-specific language (DSL) to AADL components.
AADL annex libraries contain DSL text not bound to any particular component.
</p>

<p>
BLESS defines five annex sublanguages:
<dl>
	<dt><strong>Unit</strong></dt>
		<dd>defining globally-visible units</dd>
	<dt><strong>Typedef</strong></dt>
		<dd>defining globally-visible data types</dd>
	<dt><strong>Assertion</strong></dt>
		<dd>defining globally-visible temporal logic predicates</dd>
	<dt><strong>Action</strong></dt>
		<dd>defining behavior of passive subprograms</dd>
	<dt><strong>BLESS</strong></dt>
		<dd>defining behavior of active components (i.e. threads and devices)
		which can initiate and respond to events</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>
The <strong>BLESS Editor</strong> is a plug-in to the Open-Source AADL Tool Environment (OSATE), which is 
a plug-in to Eclipse.  If you are reading this, you have both OSATE and BLESS installed.
The BLESS editor checks grammar, highlights grammar, resolves names, and checks types+units.
(BLESS v3 unifies type and unit checking.)
</p>

<p>
The <strong>BLESS Proof Assistant</strong> transforms Action and BLESS annex subclauses into deductive proofs 
given human guidance.  Action and BLESS behaviors must have non-executed assertions interspersed
between active constructs which express what's true about the program or system at particular
moments in time.

specifications, behaviors, and proofs can be found at
